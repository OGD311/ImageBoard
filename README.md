### The Project
This is my first project in PHP, so apologies if any of my code is unoptimised, buggy or just doesnt work. 
<br> I have had fun making it and am hoping to get it hosted once it is 'complete'.
<br> Any suggestions on additions or improvements are welcome :)

<br><br> I created this project as both a way to learn PHP, and also because I tried using ShimmieV2 to make an image board, but I found it to be difficult to customise and felt that some basic features were missing so I chose to implement my own version myself.
